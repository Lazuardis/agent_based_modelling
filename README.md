Hello visitors ðŸ‘‹

This repository is meant to hold my study case and project regarding Agent-Based Modelling, which for me is the coolest tool!.
However this readme will not do much as we will have particular Readme for each use case within subfolders.

But I will try to make some shortcut for you exploring outta here. Again, welcome!
